## About Me
Hello! My name is Darian Cheung and I am a first year attending Rochester Institute of Technology for Software Engineering and Computer Science. I am 17 years old, my birthday is on November 26th, 2003. I am from New York City and my high school is called Queens High School for the Sciences at York College(QHSS). My hobbies are hanging out with my girlfriend, watching anime and reading manga, trying out new sports, and cooking. My favorite anime and manga is Attack on Titan. The sport that I picked up recently since coming here is basketball, and I'm actually not that bad, but not great either. Other sports that I actually partake in are swimming and handball(NYC sport). And my favorite food is sushi.
